This is Expo React Native Project.

## Setting up your local environment
Follow the guide here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup, taking care to select the tab that says _Expo CLI Quickstart_ , not the default _React Native CLI Quickstart_.

## Getting started
1. Clone the project
2. Install Javascript dependencies
   > cd khula-schools
   > yarn
3. expo start then deploy to respective emulator

The main entry-point into the app is [App.tsx](App.tsx), which initialises an _Apollo Client_ instance for talking to the _GraphQL_ API on the backend
